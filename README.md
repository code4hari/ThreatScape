Network Traffic Analysis and Anomaly Detection
Objective: Develop a system to analyze network traffic and detect anomalies or potential security threats.
Capture and preprocess network traffic data using tools like Wireshark
Use llm’s like anthropic’s claude to identify patterns and detect anomalies in the network traffic.
Develop a user interface to visualize the analysis results and alert on detected anomalies.
Evaluate the system's performance using real-world network traffic datasets.
